# Mazethingie 
is a simple maze generator / player. I initially made it in C/C++ with SDL for the gp2x handheld around the 90's.

it was made to learn about generating mazes for another game i made named [Waternet](https://joyrider3774.itch.io/waternet).

# Aim of the game
You are the little red block stuck in a maze, you start in the lower right corner of the maze and you need to try to reach the exit in the
upper left corner. 

You can choose the maze sizes and the game will remember the previously selected size as long as they are 
still valid values, otherwise they get reset to highest values (it can happend when orientation switches)
