# Blockdude 
Blokdude is a remake of the well known TI Caluculator game from Brandon Sterner as well as the blockman game from Soleau Software. 
This version of the game is based on my GP2X version of blockdude i made over a decade ago.

## Aim of the game
The aim of the game, in any level, is to move the player to the exit door. 
You will need to create a path to this exit door by picking up blocks and placing them on strategic locations,
so you can reach the exit door. 
If the level is bigger than whats visible on the screen can display, you can use "freeview option" when holding Y + arrow keys.
It will allow you to pan around the level using the arrow keys

## MicroStudio Features
* 21 levels from original blockman game by Soleau Software + 4 levels made by me
* 5 skins to choose from
* Options to turn Sound & Music off
* Autosaves progress

## Credits
The Blockdude game idea was created by Soleau Software for the dos blockman game and Brandon Sterner for the Ti Calculator based game.
I don't know who invented the idea first. This game is a remake of the mechanics used in both those games.

The Game uses 21 levels from the Soleau Software blockman dos game. At The time i had created the gp2x version,
where this version of the game is based on i had gotten approval to use these levels.

The music was created by Don Skeeto for the gp2x version and is reused in this version of the game.

The game uses some assets from assets packs i had bought being

* stage end Sound: [game music stingers and ui sfx pack 2](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/game-music-stingers-and-ui-sfx-pack-2/)

The game has 5 skins using tilesets created by different people / games

* Default Skin: Based on the flash game created by Klas Kroon and Kris Katiesen, i had gotten permission at the time of creating the gp2x version to use these assets
* FPDefault: Based on a remake of the default skins made for the gp2x version by Fusion Power
* Tech Skin: Based on a skin made for the gp2x version by Fusion Power
* Ti Skin: Based on the assets from the Ti calculator game by brandon Sterner
